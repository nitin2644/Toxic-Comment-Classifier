Toxic Comment Classification Model
Overview
This project implements a Toxic Comment Classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. The goal is to classify comments into different toxicity categories using a deep learning model. The model is trained to identify various types of toxic behavior in text, such as insults, threats, and hate speech.

Features
Toxicity Classification: Classifies comments into six categories:
Toxic
Severe Toxic
Obscene
Threat
Insult
Identity Hate
User Interface: A Gradio-based web interface allows users to input comments and receive real-time toxicity classifications.
Preprocessing: Utilizes TensorFlow's TextVectorization for efficient text preprocessing and tokenization.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/toxic-comment-classification.git
cd toxic-comment-classification
Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Trained Model:

Ensure you have the model file (my_model.keras) in the project directory.
Update Path for Data:

Ensure the CSV file (train.csv) used for TextVectorization is correctly placed in /content/train.csv or adjust the path in the code.
Running the Application
Start the Gradio Interface:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
This will launch a Gradio interface at http://localhost:7860 (or a public URL if using Gradio's sharing feature).
Test the Model:

Enter a comment in the provided text box and receive a classification of its toxicity.
Code Explanation
app.py: Contains the Flask or Gradio app code.
predict_toxicity Function: Takes a comment, vectorizes it, predicts toxicity, and returns the highest probability label as text.
Model and Vectorizer: The model is loaded from my_model.keras, and the TextVectorization layer is adapted to the training data.
